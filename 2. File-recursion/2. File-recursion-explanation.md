## 2. Explanation File recursion exercise

Was easy, just iterate among each directory and each sub directory with a list filtering
files with the extension required

Time and Space complexity:
* Time O(n * m) -> Because per each initial folder we need to iterate among all the things inside(other variable thats m)
* Space O(n * m) -> We need an array of size m for each folder (n)
